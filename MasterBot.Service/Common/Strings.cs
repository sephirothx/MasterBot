**Description**
 - It's a competition in which clans challenge each other in real time games
 - Each clan can have at most 40 players playing per season
 - There are 6 timeslots each day: at 0:00, 4:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 UTC
 - Each player can play at most 1 game/day
 - A season lasts between one and two months
 - Games are on average 10-15 minutes long

**Benefits**
 - Getting 1st place gives the following rewards: 5,000 coins split evenly among all participants, a Rare Artifact and 1 of every Idle Power
 - You'll get to join our discord and you will be able to communicate with the best clan in clan wars and some of the best players on warlight
 - Our discord has a custom bot that will send a ping on every timeslot

**Clan Requirements**
 - We require a minimum participation of 80% for the season, but it is ok to skip one day or two when you're busy or to take a short break with notice";

        public const string FREE_WIN = @"Wait Private you don't know what a free win is and how to get it?
Then give me your ATTENTION and listen up while i explain.

You can only get a free win if all of these requirements are satisfied:
    1. No other player (or team) from your clan got a game on this template
    2. No opponents could be found for you (or your team)";

        public const string SWARM = @"Swarming happens when multiple Masters join the same template.
It has several benefits:
    1. It ensures that, if some M'Hunters are queued, we're not just filtering the hardest opponents from them
    2. It makes us get direct matchups against M'Hunters
    3. It gives us a chance of getting 'easier' opponents on average";
